# 🚨 Production CV Upload Fixes

## 🚨 **Current Issue**
The production server is getting stuck during CV upload because the ATS scoring logic isn't working properly. This guide provides immediate fixes to ensure seamless operation.

## 🔧 **Immediate Fixes Required**

### **1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)**
Add these to your Render backend environment:

```bash
# AI Configuration - MUST HAVE
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here
AI_PROVIDER=groq
AI_MODEL=llama3-8b-8192

# Feature Toggles
ENABLE_RESUME_ANALYSIS=true
ENABLE_ATS_SCORING=true
ENABLE_CONTENT_IMPROVEMENT=true
ENABLE_CHAT_ASSISTANT=true
ENABLE_JOB_SEARCH=true

# Pricing
PRICE_INR=49
FREE_TIER_LIMIT=1

# Payment (if using Razorpay)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret
```

### **2. Get Groq API Key (REQUIRED)**
1. Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign up/Login
3. Create API key (starts with `gsk_`)
4. Add to Render environment variables

## 🚀 **Deployment Steps**

### **Step 1: Configure Environment**
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select your backend service (`resume-checker-api`)
3. Go to Environment tab
4. Add all variables above
5. **Save and redeploy**

### **Step 2: Test Health Check**
After deployment, test:
```
GET https://your-backend-name.onrender.com/api/resume/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "ai": "configured",
    "database": "connected"
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Test CV Upload**
1. Upload a simple text resume
2. Check backend logs for ATS scoring messages
3. Verify score appears in frontend

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

### **✅ Timeout Protection**
- Added 30-second timeout for ATS scoring
- Added 15-second timeout for content improvement
- Prevents infinite hanging

### **✅ Fallback System**
- Automatic fallback to rule-based scoring if AI fails
- Emergency fallback if everything fails
- Ensures uploads never get stuck

### **✅ Better Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation instead of hard failures
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

### **✅ Rate Limiting**
- Reduced content improvement to 3 lines max
- Added delays between API calls
- Prevents API rate limit issues

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### **Normal Operation (AI Working)**
```
🤖 Getting AI analysis...
✅ AI Analysis Results: score: 85
✅ AI analysis completed
```

### **Fallback Operation (AI Failed)**
```
❌ AI analysis failed: [error details]
🔄 Using fallback scoring...
✅ Fallback scoring completed. Score: 75
```

### **Emergency Fallback (Everything Failed)**
```
❌ Fallback scoring also failed
⚠️ Using emergency fallback scoring
✅ Upload completed with basic scoring
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **CV Still Getting Stuck?**
1. Check Render logs for timeout errors
2. Verify `GROQ_API_KEY` is set correctly
3. Test health endpoint first
4. Check if fallback is working

### **No ATS Score?**
1. Check backend logs for scoring messages
2. Verify feature toggles are enabled
3. Test with simple text resume
4. Check API key configuration

### **Slow Performance?**
1. Reduce content improvement lines (currently 3)
2. Increase delays between API calls
3. Monitor Groq API usage
4. Check network latency

## 📝 **Monitoring Logs**

### **Success Indicators**
```
[ATS Score] Starting analysis with provider: groq
[ATS Score] AI analysis completed successfully
✅ Fallback scoring completed
```

### **Error Indicators**
```
[ATS Score] No valid API key configured
[ATS Score] Authentication failed
[ATS Score] Rate limit reached
```

## 🔄 **Quick Test**

1. **Set environment variables** in Render
2. **Redeploy backend**
3. **Test health endpoint**
4. **Upload simple resume**
5. **Check logs and frontend**

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

- **✅ CV uploads complete** in under 30 seconds
- **✅ ATS scores appear** consistently
- **✅ Fallback works** if AI fails
- **✅ No more hanging** during uploads
- **✅ Reliable service** for users
